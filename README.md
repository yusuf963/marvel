## What I could have done better if I had more time

1. Use sass for styling, and for creating global styling variables.
2. Implement better filtering functionality e.g(comic, series, year, etc)

## Why I didn't create teh character details navigate to a different page:

I rather kept the user at the same page, and just show the details of the character.on hover for a better user experience. and fast response.
